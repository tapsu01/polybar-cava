Dependencies:
- CAVA
- polybar
- font that support unicode U+2581 to U+2588 (▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█). Most [unicode fonts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_font) should support these characters

On your polybar config, add these lines
```ini
[module/cava]
type = custom/script
tail = true
exec = $HOME/.config/polybar/cava.sh
format = <label>
format-font = 5
label = %output%
```

change `exec` value to where you put `cava.sh`.

Default audio input is `alsa`.

Your can change audio input of bar by modifying the cava config section in `cava.sh`.

```
[input]
method = pulse
source = auto
```

```

## Usability in other status-bar application
The script `cava.sh` can be used in another status-bar app like Waybar. In theory, any app that can display unicode characters can use the script.
`cava.sh` is a standalone script that does not require polybar and just outputting text (unicode). You can even try running it directly in the terminal to see the output.
